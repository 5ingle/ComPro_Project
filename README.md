#Please read!bui

Step 1 : Make a branch for yourself (or use other developer's branch) NOT MASTER BRANCH!
Step 2 : Make a change
Step 3 : Create Pull requests from your branch to master
Step 4 : Merge requests requires file to be compilable! Broken file will not be allowed into master
Step 5 : YAY! Product is now served!

#Master branch push rules
1) Travis CLI will check that the file is able to compile (using GCC) or not

Failed at compiling will denied your pull requests!

2) You cannot do push to master branch. Every PUSH requests will be denied and failed. Please go and fix your problem, and try again.

3) It may takes some period of time to compile the file. Please be very patient about that!
